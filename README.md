A cleverly named bug tracking application written in Rust and Tauri

## Why Does This App Exist?

This is a practice app I wrote for learning Rust. I always find it is easiest to learn a new programming language when you have an actual task to do, so that's what this is.

You really shouldn't use this for anything serious.

However, if you want to review my code and suggest improvements or things that could be done better, that would be great!
